#Project Step 1

This document intends to explore the presentation and functionality of a few notable web applications. By the end of this document, the three analyzed web applications should be layed out clearly in terms of a conceptual understanding of the purpose, usage, and presentation. This is by no means intended to be a technical breakdown of their operations. For the purposes of this document I have selected the following three websites: Youtube, Twitch, and Wikipedia.

To begin we will start with Youtube. This site takes a user's given information and usage history to display a custom feed of videos from their data centers that the given user is likely to be interested in. These videos are themselves posted by other user's of the website. This effectively makes Youtube a social media site centered around the sharing of video content. The site utilizes a simple interface with a colapsable navigation panel to the left side of the screen, a search bar at the top and the users customized feed encompassing the majority of the page. The feed consists of a gallery of sorts where each image has an information block beneath it that provide the name of the video to which it references as well as who posted that video, roughly how many views it has, and about how long ago it was posted. hovering over an image will activate a short and quick slideshow to better convey the contents of the video.

Next we will discuss Twitch. This site, like Youtube, presents the User with a custom feed of sorts. Rather than being a gallery of video thumbnails though, each image presented to the user on twitch's main page represents either an active live stream of other users playing videogames or a reference to a particular video game, that once clicked, takes the user to another list of active streamers that are all playing that videogame. The left hand pane on this sites main page usually consists of a list of channels (other users streams) that the user is "following" and/or a list of recommended channels that the user might be interested in following. Following a channel adds that channel to a short list for the users convenience and if they have notifications on they will be alerted to status updates about that channel.

Finally we will be discussing Wikipedia. One major difference between this site and the other two site previously discussed is that the average user on this site does not tend to have a user profile. This however does not mean the site does not rely on its profile possessing users. In fact, much like the other two sites, all of the content on this site is created, maintained, and policed nearly entirely by these users. The main page for this site consists of a language selection wheel that encompasses nearly half of the screen which is folowed immediatly by a search bar that also has a language drop down menu. The bottom half of the screen is a linked list of other Wikimedia Foundation sites. Once the site is searched it will display a list of relevant results. Each of which is an informational/educational article on a given subject or a definition/etymology of a given term.

Within this document we have discussed three aspects of three websites: how they are presented to users, what functionality they provide, and what data they utilize. By this point broad view understanding of each of these sites has been achieved. Though each site contains enough complexity to easily be discussed in much greater detail, for the purposes of this document each site has been presented and clearly defined.
